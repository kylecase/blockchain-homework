# blockchain-homework

## Purpose
Created a PyChain ledger for tracking transactions between senders and receivers.

## Processes
- Built a Record class that would provide type validation for senders, receivers, and the amount to transact.
- Built user interface inputs for taking in sender, receiver, and amount data as inputs, and a button to allow the user to submit a transaction.
- Updated block logic to utilize the record class.

## Result
A streamlit application that allows a user to send/receive funds and each block is stored and rendered as a dataframe.

## Summary
This module demonstrated a simple blockchain and the logic necessary to build it. It also utilized streamlit to provide an interface to take in use input for creating blockchain transactions.
